# Fundamentals of Data Analysis (5 Credits)

This repository contains the Fundamentals of Data Analysis Assignment (Oct/Nov 2018).

The primary document is the Jupyter Notebook "FDA_Assignment.ipynb".

All supplimentary documentation begins with a "z_" in order for it to remain at the bottom of the list of files.  

NOTE: much research and code was prepared while I spent significant time travelling for work this month and was added to the Jupyter Notebook over a small numebr of days while I was home and had access to the computer running Anaconda/Python etc. The activity tracker may not look very impresive in git hub but activities were happening offline.
